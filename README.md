# net-chess

## Proposal
In this project, we plan to implement a 2-player chess game over network. The board position is shown as TUI using brick library which keeps updating after each player move. The game needs to be played using the [chess moves notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)). We will use network library for handling p2p communication. If time permits we will take a pre-built haskell chess engine and add functionality of a player playing with computer.
